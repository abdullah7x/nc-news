# Northcoders News

## Background

As part of my coding journey at the Northcoders bootcamp I created an API for programmatically retrieving application data. I have now created website which retrieves news articles and information regarding them from the API and allows you to view and interact with them in a more user friendly format.

note: `V17` is the minimum version of node required to run this project locally.
